# Survival Mindset & Priorities
In any emergency, remember the rule of threes:
- 3 minutes without air / severe bleeding
- 3 hours without shelter in bad conditions
- 3 days without water
- 3 weeks without food

Focus on **airway**, **bleeding control**, **shelter/warmth**, **water**, then **food**.
